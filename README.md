# Discord AI Chatbot
This Discord bot is able to generate AI responses, leveraging the GPT4o-mini model. As a cool feature, this bot is also able to imitate any character from TV shows, Anime, Movies, Video Games, etc.    

This repo is using Viktor from the Arcane series as an example:

There are 2 other example characters in this repo: Goku and Elon Musk. You can add more characters in the characters.py file.

You will need to supply your own OpenAI and Discord Bot tokens for this program to work. Create a Python file called "api.py" and create a "token" and "openapi" variable that will hold your tokens.
